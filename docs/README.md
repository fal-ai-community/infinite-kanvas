## CLAUDE.md Files Created

### Project-Level Documentation

- **[Project Root](../CLAUDE.md)**: Overview of the entire project
- **[PartyKit Server](../party/CLAUDE.md)**: WebSocket server implementation
- **[App Router](../src/app/CLAUDE.md)**: Next.js App Router structure

### Feature Documentation

- **[Canvas Components](../src/components/canvas/CLAUDE.md)**: Canvas editing system
- **[Multiplayer Library](../src/lib/multiplayer/CLAUDE.md)**: Real-time collaboration
- **[Authentication Library](../src/lib/auth/CLAUDE.md)**: Clerk integration
- **[Cloudflare Services](../src/lib/cloudflare/CLAUDE.md)**: Cloudflare service utilities

### Data Layer

- **[Database Layer](../src/db/CLAUDE.md)**: Drizzle ORM with D1 database

## Key Architecture Highlights

### Multiplayer Implementation

- PartyKit WebSocket server for real-time communication
- Jotai atoms for multiplayer state management
- Adapter pattern for clean single/multiplayer separation
- Event-driven architecture with typed events
- Automatic reconnection and error handling

### Cloudflare Integration

- D1 database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations
- R2 object storage for images and assets
- KV cache for rate limiting and presence data
- Edge-optimized performance globally
- Consistent security and access patterns

### Authentication Flow

- Clerk authentication with Clerk Elements components
- Middleware-based route protection
- Seamless integration with multiplayer features
- User data synchronization via webhooks
- Multiple authentication methods support

### Storage Architecture

- Multi-layered storage strategy
- R2 for large binary files (images, videos)
- KV for fast key-value operations (cache, rate limiting)
- Database for structured data persistence
- Secure access patterns with signed URLs

## Development Patterns

### File Organization

- CLAUDE.md files in all key directories
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe development with TypeScript

### State Management

- Jotai for client-side global state
- React Query for server state
- Component-level state with React hooks
- Multiplayer state via WebSocket synchronization

### API Design

- tRPC for type-safe APIs
- RESTful patterns for external integrations
- WebSocket events for real-time updates
- Consistent error handling and validation

## Next Steps

### Documentation Maintenance

- Keep CLAUDE.md files updated with code changes
- Add new architecture decisions to appropriate guides
- Update troubleshooting sections based on real issues
- Include example workflows for common operations

### Expansion Areas

- Testing framework documentation
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Advanced multiplayer features (permissions, recordings)

### Performance Guides

- Database optimization techniques
- Caching strategies at all layers
- CDN configuration and optimization
- Mobile performance considerations
